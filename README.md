# Malle-Project-AI-Content-Finder-
This project proposes the development of an AI-powered system for detecting and locating copies of digital content (images/videos) on the public internet. The system allows a user to upload a reference copy of an image or video, which is then analyzed by AI models. The goal is to identify exact or transformed duplicates across publicly accessible sources and report their URLs. The system does not delete or access private content, focusing strictly on public sources to remain safe and legally compliant.
The system has multiple socially beneficial applications, including helping individuals or organizations locate leaked private media, aiding in the fight against illegal distribution of personal content, and supporting abuse reporting teams.
